ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luka Gurjidze, an aspiring IT student from Tbilisi, Georgia, with a passion for technology and a strong foundation in Python, Django, and web development. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of software development while pursuing my IT degree at the Business and Technology University. I've honed my skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning, including completing several Udemy and CodewithMosh courses on Python, Django, and full-stack web development.


ðŸ’¡ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. I'm particularly interested in leveraging Python and Django to solve complex problems and create impactful software solutions.

ðŸŒ± Besides coding, I enjoy playing chess, which sharpens my strategic thinking and problem-solving skillsâ€”attributes that I believe are crucial in the tech world.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or drop me an email at lgurjidze@gmail.com for collaborations or if you're interested in learning more about my projects.
